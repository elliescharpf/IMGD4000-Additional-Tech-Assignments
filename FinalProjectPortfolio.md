# IMGD4000 - Final Project Portfolio

## Role in the Project
I served as the **audio lead** for our project while also helping out wherever needed. My responsibilities included designing, implementing, editing, and troubleshooting all aspects of the audio for the game. These included ambient soundscapes, interactive cues, puzzle feedback, and realistic sound effects. Beyond audio, I also contributed to architectural decisions within the level, implementation of journal entries, and team website creation.

## Challenges Faced
Some of the main challenges I faced included:

- **Version control conflicts**  
  Managing GitHub branches when multiple teammates worked on overlapping Blueprints. To overcome this we used GitHub Desktop with branching workflows. I had a dedicated audio branch, merged via pull requests, and solved conflicts by documenting Blueprint changes if they would need to be recreated later.

- **Keeping track of audio**  
  Managing audio files between downloads, editing, and implementing got tricky at some points due to name changes and forgetting which sound files were supposed to be attached to which objects. To overcome this I made a spreadsheet that included the sound type, its uses, name of the file, description, implemented? checkbox, and the attribution which included a link back to the original source.

- **Overall conflicts in a large team**  
  Sometimes when trying to work on things it gets difficult to collaborate when you don’t understand the logic behind someone else’s part of the project, or when you need to implement something but you’re waiting on someone else’s part to be finished before you can add yours. Merging branches on GitHub can also become difficult when working in large groups. To overcome this I had to spend more time learning other people’s processes and keeping extra tasks I could work on while waiting for someone else to finish their section.

## Lessons Learned
I think future students should make sure to clearly and consistently communicate. It would have been really helpful for us to meet more often and make sure everyone gave an update on their progress, roadblocks, and what they were going to be working on next. This can also help with version control and merging more frequently so you don’t run into bigger merge conflicts later on.  

Also, starting with a small project that you can add onto is a lot better than having a big project that is not polished.

## Version Control Experience
We used **GitHub Desktop** and all had our own branches to work on. I found it relatively easy to use, especially if you’re constantly updating from `main` while other people are pushing to `main`. While Blueprint differences are not as clear as code differences, consistent commit messages and team communication helped us avoid merge disasters as best as we could.  

This experience reinforced the importance of version control not just for code, but for collaborative design assets as well.
