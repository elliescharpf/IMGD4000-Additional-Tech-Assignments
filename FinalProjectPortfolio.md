# IMGD4000 - Final Project Portfolio

## Role in the Project
I served as the audio lead for our project while also helping out wherever needed. My responsibilities included designing, implementing, editing, and troubleshooting all aspects of the audio for the game. These included ambient soundscapes, interactive cues, puzzle feedback, and realistic sound effects. Beyond audio, I also contributed to architectural decisions within the level, implementation of journal entries, and team website creation.

## Challenges Faced
Some of the main challenges I faced included:

- **Version control conflicts**  
  Managing GitHub branches when multiple teammates worked on overlapping Blueprints got difficult at some points. To overcome this we used GitHub Desktop with branching workflows. I had a dedicated audio branch, merged via pull requests, and solved conflicts by documenting Blueprint changes if they would need to be recreated later.

- **Keeping track of audio**  
  Managing audio files between downloads, editing, and implementing got tricky at some points due to name changes and forgetting which sound files were supposed to be attached to which objects. To overcome this I made a spreadsheet that included the sound type, its uses, name of the file, description, implemented? checkbox, and the attribution which included a link back to the original source.

- **Overall conflicts in a large team**  
Collaborating within a large team often presented challenges. At times, it was difficult to integrate my work when I didn’t fully understand the logic behind another teammate’s implementation, or when my tasks depended on components that were still in progress. Version control also became more complex as multiple branches were merged simultaneously. To address these issues, I invested extra time in learning how other team members structured their work, which improved my ability to integrate with their systems. I also kept a set of secondary tasks on hand so I could remain productive while waiting for dependencies to be completed.

## Lessons Learned
Future students should prioritize clear and consistent communication throughout their projects. Regular check‑ins where each team member shares progress, identifies roadblocks, and outlines upcoming tasks would have greatly improved our workflow. This kind of structured communication also supports healthier version control practices, since frequent updates and merges reduce the risk of major conflicts later on.
Another key lesson is to start small and iterate. Beginning with a manageable, polished core project and gradually expanding it is far more effective than attempting to build something large and complex from the start, only to struggle with unfinished or unrefined features.

## Version Control Experience
We used **GitHub Desktop** and all had our own branches to work on. I found it relatively easy to use, especially if you’re constantly updating from `main` while other people are pushing to `main`. While Blueprint differences are not as clear as code differences, consistent commit messages and team communication helped us avoid merge disasters as best as we could.  

This experience reinforced the importance of version control not just for code, but for collaborative design assets as well.
